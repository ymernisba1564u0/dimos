# What is Dimensional?

DimOS is both a language-agnostic framework and a Python-first library for robot control. It has optional ROS integration and is designed to let AI agents invoke tools (skills), directly access sensor and state data, and generate complex emergent behaviors.

The python library comes with a rich set of integrations; visualizers, spatial reasoners, planners, simulators (mujoco, Isaac Sim, etc.), robot state/action primitives, and more.

# How do I get started?

### Installation

- Linux is supported, with tests being performed on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- MacOS support is in beta, you're welcome to try it *but expect inconsistent/flakey behavior (rather than errors/crashing)*
    - instead of the apt-get command below run: `brew install gnu-sed gcc portaudio git-lfs libjpeg-turbo python`

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl g++ portaudio19-dev git-lfs libturbojpeg python3-dev
# install uv for python
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

#
# NOTE!!! the first time, you're going to have an empty/black rerun window for a while
#
# the command needs to download the replay file (2.4gb), which takes a bit

# OPTION 1: install dimos in a virtualenv
uv venv && . .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install 'dimos[base,unitree]'
# replay recorded data to test that the system is working
dimos --replay run unitree-go2

# OPTION 2: if you want to test out dimos without installing run:
uvx --from 'dimos[base,unitree]' dimos --replay run unitree-go2
```

<!-- command for testing pre launch: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" uv pip install 'dimos[unitree] @ git+ssh://git@github.com/dimensionalOS/dimos.git@dev'` -->

### Usage

#### Control a robot in a simulation (no robot required)

After running the commads below, open http://localhost:7779/command-center to control the robot movement.

```sh
export DISPLAY=:1 # Or DISPLAY=:0 if getting GLFW/OpenGL X11 errors
# ignore the warp warnings
dimos --viewer-backend rerun-web --simulation run unitree-go2
```

### Unitree G1 SDK2 policies (MuJoCo + real robot)

#### Install extras

```sh
# SDK2 DDS + Unitree SDK2 Python bindings
uv pip install 'dimos[base,unitree,sdk2]'

# Optional: Falcon loco_manip upper-body IK (Pinocchio-only, pip-friendly)
uv pip install 'dimos[falcon]'
```

#### Policy selection via `bundle.json`

MuJoCo profiles can include `data/mujoco_sim/<profile>/bundle.json` with:

- `policy`: ONNX filename (in the profile folder)
- `robot_type`: usually `"g1"`
- `policy_kind`:
  - `"mjlab_velocity"` (default)
  - `"falcon_loco_manip"`
- `policy_config`: (Falcon only) YAML filename (in the profile folder)

Example:

```json
{
  "robot_type": "g1",
  "policy_kind": "falcon_loco_manip",
  "policy": "policy.onnx",
  "policy_config": "g1_29dof_falcon.yaml",
  "mode_pr": 0,
  "policy_action_scale": 0.25
}
```

#### Run: sim2sim (SDK2)

```sh
MUJOCO_CONTROL_MODE=sdk2 dimos --mujoco-profile unitree_g1_sdk2 run unitree-g1-sim
```

#### Run: sim2real (mirror visualization + real robot commands)

```sh
SDK2_INTERFACE=en7 SDK2_DOMAIN_ID=0 MUJOCO_CONTROL_MODE=mirror dimos --mujoco-profile unitree_g1_sdk2 run unitree-g1-sim
```

Open Command Center at `http://localhost:7779/command-center`:
- **Enable Policy / E‑Stop** controls arming
- **Falcon panel** publishes policy params (`stand`, base height, waist, EE targets, IK toggle, collision-check toggle)

#### Get it working on a physical robot!

```sh
export ROBOT_IP=PUT_YOUR_IP_ADDR_HERE
dimos --viewer-backend rerun-web run unitree-go2
```

#### Have it controlled by AI!

WARNING: This is a demo showing the **connection** between AI and robotic control -- not a demo of a super-intelligent AI. Be ready to physically prevent your robot from taking dumb physical actions.

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your private key>
dimos --viewer-backend rerun-web run unitree-go2-agentic
```

After running that, open a new terminal and run the following to start giving instructions to the agent.
```sh
# activate the venv in this new terminal
source .venv/bin/activate

# Note: after running the next command, WAIT for the agent to connect
# (this will take a while the first time)
# then tell the agent "explore the room"
# then tell it to go to something, ex: "go to the door"
humancli
```

# How do I use it as a library?

### Simple Camera Activation

Assuming you have a webcam, save the following as a python file and run it:

```py
from dimos.core.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.hardware.sensors.camera.module import CameraModule

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autoconnect(
        # technically autoconnect is not needed because we only have 1 module
        CameraModule.blueprint()
    ).build().loop()
```

### Write A Custom Module

Lets convert the camera's image to grayscale.

```py
from dimos.core.blueprints import autoconnect
from dimos.core import In, Out, Module, rpc
from dimos.hardware.sensors.camera.module import CameraModule
from dimos.msgs.sensor_msgs import Image

from reactivex.disposable import Disposable

class Listener(Module):
    # the CameraModule has an Out[Image] named "color_image"
    # How do we know this? Just print(CameraModule.module_info().outputs)
    # the name ("color_image") must match the CameraModule's output
    color_image: In[Image] = None
    grayscale_image: Out[Image] = None

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.count = 0

    @rpc
    def start(self) -> None:
        super().start()
        def callback_func(img: Image) -> None:
            self.count += 1
            print(f"got frame {self.count}")
            print(f"img.data.shape: {img.data.shape}")
            self.grayscale_image.publish(img.to_grayscale())

        unsubscribe_func = self.color_image.subscribe(callback_func)
        # the unsubscribe_func be called when the module is stopped
        self._disposables.add(Disposable(
            unsubscribe_func
        ))

    @rpc
    def stop(self) -> None:
        super().stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    autoconnect(
        Listener.blueprint(),
        CameraModule.blueprint(),
    ).build().loop()
```

#### Note: Many More Examples in the [Examples Folder](./examples)

### How do custom modules work? (Example breakdown)

- Every module represents one process: modules run in parallel (python multiprocessing). Because of this **modules should only save/modify data on themselves**. Do not mutate or share global vars inside a module.
- At the top of this module definition, the In/Out **streams** are defining a pub-sub system. This module expects *someone somewhere* to give it a color image. And, the module is going to publish a grayscale image (that any other module to subscribe to).
    - Note: if you are a power user thinking "so streams must be statically declared?" the answer is no, there are ways to perform dynamic connections, but for type-checking and human sanity the creation of dynamic stream connections are under an advanced API and should be used as a last resort.
- The `autoconnect` ties everything together:
  - The CameraModule has an output of `color_image`
  - The Listener has an input of `color_image`
  - Autoconnect puts them together, and checks that their types are compatible (both are of type `Image`)
- How can we see what In/Out streams are provided by a module?
  - Open a python repl (e.g. `python`)
  - Import the module, ex: `from dimos.hardware.sensors.camera.module import CameraModule`
  - Print the module outputs: `print(CameraModule.module_info().outputs)`
  - Print the module inputs: `print(CameraModule.module_info().inputs)`
  - Print all the information (rpcs, skills, etc): `print(CameraModule.module_info())`
- What about `@rpc`?
   - If you want a method to be called by another module (not just an internal method) then add the `@rpc` decorator AND make sure BOTH the arguments and return value of the method are json-serializable.
   - Rpc methods get called using threads, meaning two rpc methods can be running at the same time. For this reason, python thread locking is often necessary for data that is being written/read during rpc calls.
   - The start/stop methods always need to be an rpc because they are called externally.

### Monitoring & Debugging

In addition to rerun logging, DimOS comes with a number of monitoring tools:
- Run `lcmspy` to see how fast messages are being published on streams.
- Run `skillspy` to see how skills are being called, how long they are running, which are active, etc.
- Run `agentspy` to see the agent's status over time.
- If you suspect there is a bug within DimOS itself, you can enable extreme logging by prefixing the dimos command with `DIMOS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG RERUN_SAVE=1 `. Ex: `DIMOS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG RERUN_SAVE=1 dimos --replay run unitree-go2`


# How does Dimensional work?

Concepts:
- [Modules](/docs/concepts/modules.md): The building blocks of DimOS, modules run in parallel and are singleton python classes.
- [Streams](/docs/api/sensor_streams/index.md): How modules communicate, a Pub / Sub system.
- [Blueprints](/dimos/core/README_BLUEPRINTS.md): a way to group modules together and define their connections to each other.
- [RPC](/dimos/core/README_BLUEPRINTS.md#calling-the-methods-of-other-modules): how one module can call a method on another module (arguments get serialized to JSON-like binary data).
- [Skills](/dimos/core/README_BLUEPRINTS.md#defining-skills): An RPC function, except it can be called by an AI agent (a tool for an AI).
- Agents: AI that has an objective, access to stream data, and is capable of calling skills as tools.
