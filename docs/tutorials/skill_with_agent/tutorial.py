    # Building your first DimOS skill, part 2: Adding an LLM agent

    In [part 1](../skill_basics/tutorial.py), you built a greeter skill and invoked it manually via `SkillCoordinator.call_skill()`.
    This gave you a foundation for understanding how skills work under the hood.

    In part 2, you'll wire up your greeter to an **LLM agent**.
    With this, you can command the agent to call the greeter skill -- to greet -- by simply asking it to "say hello to Alice".

    ## Step 1: Enable agent auto-registration

    When you compose a skill module with `llm_agent()`, the framework needs to discover which skills to expose.
    In part 1, we did this manually by calling `skill_coordinator.register_skills(greeter)`.
    For agent composition, modules declare themselves as skill providers through a hook method.

    ### The auto-registration hook

    Here's our `GreeterForAgents`, which extends `Greeter` from part 1 with one additional method:
    """)

def _(mo):
    mo.md("""
    The method name `set_LlmAgent_register_skills` follows a naming convention that DimOS uses to discover skill providers.
    When you call `.build()` on a blueprint containing both this module and `llm_agent()`, this hook is called to register your skills.

    /// note | The naming convention for `set_`-prefixed methods
    Suppose you have a method like `set_Mod_some_method` on module `A`.
    The blueprint system will try looking for a Module in the combined blueprint named `Mod` with a method named `some_method`.
    If it finds such a Module and method, the blueprint system
    will call the original method with the matched method; i.e.,
    in this case, it will call `<instance of A>.set_Mod_some_method(<instance of Mod>.some_method)`.
    ///

    The method body is boilerplate. It does basically the same thing we did with `skill_coordinator.register_skills(greeter)` in the previous tutorial; i.e., it wires up the registration callback.

    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/blueprints.py:396-405 - Convention: methods starting with set_ are called with matching RPC references -->

    ### The SkillModule shortcut

    Since this hook is so common, there's a convenience class that adds it for you:

    ```python
    from dimos.core.skill_module import SkillModule

    class MySkills(SkillModule):
        @skill()
        def do_something(self) -> str:
            ...
    ```

    `SkillModule` is just `Module` plus the `set_LlmAgent_register_skills` method shown above.


    You might want to use the explicit pattern

    * when extending an existing class (like we're doing here)
    * when you have more than one module that subclasses `LlmAgent` (e.g. in a multi-agent setup)
    * or when you need custom serialization

    but otherwise, you can just subclass `SkillModule`.

    ### An alternative terminal-based workflow

    A notebook is helpful for prototyping and experimenting,
    but often you would want to do things in the terminal, instead of a notebook.

    DimOS provides TUI helpers to facilitate this workflow: you can run the agent as a standalone script and interact with it via TUIs like `dimos.agents2.cli.human.humancli`.

    **In a terminal pane: Run the agent system**
    ```bash
    python docs/tutorials/skill_with_agent/cli.py
    ```

    **In another terminal pane: Send messages to the agent**
    ```bash
    python -m dimos.agents2.cli.human.humancli
    ```
    This opens up a TUI that you can use to send messages.

    **Optionally, in yet another terminal pane: Use `agentspy` to monitor agent activity**
    ```bash
    python -m dimos.utils.cli.agentspy.agentspy
    ```

    This opens a TUI that shows all messages flowing through the agent in real-time:

    - **Human** (green): Messages you send
    - **Agent** (yellow): LLM responses and tool calls
    - **Tool** (red): Skill execution results
    - **System** (red): System prompts

    Useful for debugging or improving your understanding of what's happening under the hood.

    ### The key stages

    1. **Skill discovery**: When the system starts, `llm_agent` finds modules with `set_LlmAgent_register_skills` and calls that method.
       Your `GreeterForAgents` registers its `greet` skill.

    2. **Tool schema generation**: The agent converts `@skill` methods into tool schemas that the LLM understands.


       /// tip | Write descriptive docstrings!
       Your skill's docstring becomes the tool description.


       That's why you want the docstrings to be descriptive (and optimized for LLMs), if you are using an LLM agent.
       ///


    4. **Agent reasoning**: When you type "say hello to Bob", the agent considers available tools and decides to call `greet` with `name="Bob"`.

    5. **Skill execution**: The agent's tool call goes through `SkillCoordinator`, which invokes your skill method and returns the result.

    6. **Response**: The agent receives the skill result and formulates a natural language response.

    <!-- Citation: dimos/protocol/skill/schema.py:63-103 - function_to_schema extracts docstring -->

    ## Key takeaways

    1. **Auto-registration via convention**: The `set_LlmAgent_register_skills` method lets the framework wire your skills to agents automatically.

    2. **Natural language to tool calls**: Agents convert natural language requests into skill invocations, using your docstrings to understand what each skill does.

    3. **Composition with the blueprint system**: Combine skill modules, `llm_agent()`, and `human_input()` declaratively; DimOS handles the wiring.

    ## What's next

    - **Add more skills**: Try adding a `farewell` skill and see how the agent uses both.
    - **Stream progress**: For long-running skills, use `stream=Stream.call_agent` to send updates to the agent as work progresses.
    - **Explore real robot skills**: Check out `dimos/agents2/skills/navigation.py` for examples of navigation skills.
