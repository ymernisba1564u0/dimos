    ## Step 1: Define the skill (and its containing module)

    Before jumping into how to define skills, let's first establish some background: What even are skills; how do they enter the picture?

    On the DimOS framework, programming a robot involves composing [*modules*](../../concepts/modules.md). These might be modules that endow the robot with some sort of skill or capability -- e.g. perception or navigation capabilities -- or 'agentic' modules that orchestrate the use of certain capabilities.

    At a high level, then, skills are capabilities for your robot. But at a more prosaic level, they are just methods on a `Module` that have been wrapped with a special decorator, the `@skill` decorator. (As we'll see in the next tutorial, this allows them to be invoked by LLM agents as tool calls.)

    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/module.py:77 - ModuleBase inherits from SkillContainer -->
    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/module.py:85 - rpc_calls list declaration -->

    So, to define a skill for greeting people, we need to define a module that'll house the greeting skill method, as well as the method itself:

    There are two things to explain here: (i) the declaration of the module's dependencies in `rpc_calls` and (ii) the `@skill` decorator.

    ### Dependency injection

    Notice how `Greeter` declares its dependencies in the `rpc_calls` list:

    - `rpc_calls` declares what methods this module needs from other modules
    - while `get_rpc_calls()` retrieves the actual method references at runtime

    This is *dependency injection*: `Greeter` doesn't import `RobotCapabilities` directly.
    Instead, the dependencies are supplied at runtime, when the modules are wired up with `autoconnect` (more on this later).
    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/module.py:268-275 - get_rpc_calls() retrieves from _bound_rpc_calls -->
    <!-- Citation: dimos/protocol/skill/skill.py:65-113 - @skill decorator implementation -->

    ### `@skill`

    The `@skill()` decorator transforms a method into an agent-callable tool — generating a JSON schema from your signature, tracking execution state, and running in background threads.

    For simple skills, `@skill()` with no arguments works fine (as in `Greeter.greet`). For streaming or background data, you'd use parameters like `stream` and `reducer` — see the [Skills concept guide](../../concepts/skills.md) and the `@skill`-related docstrings for details.

    Your docstring becomes the tool description LLMs see — write it for an LLM audience.

    #### Why does `RobotCapabilities` use `@rpc` for `speak`?

    Whether to use `@rpc` or `@skill` depends on what you want the method to be used for.

    - `@rpc` methods are for module-to-module communication via `get_rpc_calls()`
    - `@skill` methods are for invocation by agents; they come with additional infrastructure that we'll see shortly.

    That is, we're using `@rpc` for `speak` since we aren't trying to expose it to agents -- since it's more of a lower-level capability that's used by the higher-level skills.

    ## Step 3: Combine Module blueprints with `autoconnect`

    Now that we've defined the constituent modules of our system, now that we have defined blueprints for each of them, we can reduce them down to a combined blueprint with `autoconnect`.

    (We can also optionally override the default global configuration, as is done here with `n_dask_workers`.)

    The `build` method wires up the modules, deploys them to worker(s), and starts them;
    it returns a `ModuleCoordinator` instance that manages the deployed modules.

    <!-- TODO: Add link to API reference for ModuleCoordinator -->

    ### Dependency injection, redux

    It's worth pausing to reflect on the wiring up of modules.

    Recall that `Greeter` had declared it needs certain dependencies.
    When we build the blueprint, the blueprint system

    - checks what dependencies the various modules require; e.g., that `Greeter` needs `RobotCapabilities.speak`
    - and wires up the modules so these dependencies are supplied.
    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/blueprints.py - _connect_rpc_methods -->
    <!-- Citation: dimos/core/blueprints.py:203 - instance.set_rpc_method() binds RPC calls -->

    This, in other words, is the runtime dependency injection we had alluded to.

    ### Use the `loop` method for long-running applications

    After `build()`, the system is already running. For long-running applications (e.g. an honest-to-goodness robot),
    use the `loop()` method to keep the process alive:

    ```python
    dimos.loop()
    ```

    This sleeps indefinitely until interrupted (Ctrl+C / SIGINT), whereupon it calls `stop()` to shut down gracefully.

    We won't need to do that in this tutorial, though -- we'll just call `stop()` at the end.

    ### Key takeaways

    Let's recap:

    **Blueprints allow you to declaratively specify and combine modules**, with runtime dependency injection.

    **Skills are methods with superpowers** — The `@skill` decorator transforms regular methods into agent-callable tools with built-in execution tracking.

    **Skill invocations are tracked** — the `call_id` lets you monitor multiple concurrent executions.

    ### What's next?

    In part 2 of this tutorial, you'll see how LLM agents use this exact same pattern to invoke skills as *tool calls*. The agent will decide when to greet, who to greet, and orchestrate complex behaviors by combining multiple skills!
