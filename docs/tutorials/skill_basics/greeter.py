"""DimOS skill tutorial: module definitions.

This file contains the module classes for the skill basics tutorial.

Note that these classes cannot be defined in the __main__ of the script
that's used to orchestrate the DimOS run,
because DimOS uses Dask with process-based workers,
and classes defined in __main__
(notebooks, scripts) cannot be pickled to other processes.
