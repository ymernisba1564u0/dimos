    # Multi-agent tutorial: Build yourself a RoboButler

    In this tutorial, we'll build a RoboButler multi-agent system (for one robot)
    consisting of a Planner agent and specialist sub-agents.
    To keep things simple, we'll have just two sub-agents: one for giving advice on socio-emotional matters,
    and another for managing schedules.
    The Planner coordinates and consults with the specialists,
    before taking the appropriate actions.

    ## Step 1: Make the Agent `Module`s

    As before, we need to start by defining the `Modules` of our system.
    To keep things simple, let's start with just the Agent modules; agents, recall, are basically `Module`s that can communicate via RPC.

    How exactly to do this, however, isn't immediately obvious. To see why, consider how communicating via RPC implies that we'll need to be able to call the `query` method of each of these agents. But if we're combining multiple `LlmAgent` modules in a blueprint, how is the blueprint system going to know which agent should receive a call to `LlmAgent.query`?

    /// tip
    If the details of the RPC mechanism are foggy, it might be worth looking at [the first tutorial](../skill_basics/tutorial.md) again.
