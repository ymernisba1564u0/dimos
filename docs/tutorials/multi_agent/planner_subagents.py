"""Multi-agent tutorial: Planner + Subagents pattern.

This file contains the module and agent classes for the multi-agent tutorial.

Note: can't use both @skill and @rpc decorators together for a method:
    Methods decorated with both @skill() and @rpc cannot be referenced via
    RPC from other modules. The @skill() decorator wraps the method in a local
    function that cannot be pickled for LCM transport. Workarounds:

    1. Use only @skill() if the method is called by agents as a tool
    2. Use only @rpc if the method is called via RPC from other modules
    3. If both are needed, create separate methods or have the calling module
       implement the functionality directly

# the source agent in the query string itself (e.g., "FROM:PlannerAgent|actual query").
# The receiving agent parses this out before processing. This should eventually be
# replaced by proper metadata support in the RPC/Agent infrastructure.
