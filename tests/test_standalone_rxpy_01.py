    Test 1: Periodic Emission Test

    This test creates a ThreadPoolScheduler that leverages as many threads as there are CPU 
    cores available, optimizing the execution across multiple threads. The core functionality
    revolves around an observable, secondly_emission, which emits a value every second. 
    Each emission is an incrementing integer, which is then mapped to a message indicating 
    the number of seconds since the test began. The sequence is limited to 30 emissions, 
    each logged as it occurs, and accompanied by an additional message via the 
    emission_process function to indicate the value's emission. The test subscribes to the 
    observable to print each emitted value, handle any potential errors, and confirm 
    completion of the emissions after 30 seconds.

    Key Components:
        •	ThreadPoolScheduler: Manages concurrency with multiple threads.
        •	Observable Sequence: Emits every second, indicating progression with a specific 
            message format.
        •	Subscription: Monitors and logs emissions, errors, and the completion event.

    Test 2: Combined Emission Test

    In this test, a similar ThreadPoolScheduler setup is used to handle tasks across multiple
    CPU cores efficiently. This setup includes two observables. The first, secondly_emission,
    emits an incrementing integer every second, indicating the passage of time. The second 
    observable, immediate_emission, emits a predefined sequence of characters (['a', 'b', 
    'c', 'd', 'e']) repeatedly and immediately. These two streams are combined using the zip 
    operator, which synchronizes their emissions into pairs. Each combined pair is formatted 
    and logged, indicating both the time elapsed and the immediate value emitted at that 
    second.

    A synchronization mechanism via an Event (completed_event) ensures that the main program 
    thread waits until all planned emissions are completed before exiting. This test not only
    checks the functionality of zipping different rhythmic emissions but also demonstrates
    handling of asynchronous task completion in Python using event-driven programming.

    Key Components:
        •	Combined Observable Emissions: Synchronizes periodic and immediate emissions into
            a single stream.
        •	Event Synchronization: Uses a threading event to manage program lifecycle and 
            ensure that all emissions are processed before shutdown.
        •	Complex Subscription Management: Handles errors and completion, including 
            setting an event to signal the end of task processing.
