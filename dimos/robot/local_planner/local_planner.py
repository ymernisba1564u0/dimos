    """
    Abstract base class for local planners that handle obstacle avoidance and path following.

    This class defines the common interface and shared functionality that all local planners
    must implement, regardless of the specific algorithm used.

    Args:
        get_costmap: Function to get the latest local costmap
        get_robot_pose: Function to get the latest robot pose (returning odom object)
        move: Function to send velocity commands
        safety_threshold: Distance to maintain from obstacles (meters)
        max_linear_vel: Maximum linear velocity (m/s)
        max_angular_vel: Maximum angular velocity (rad/s)
        lookahead_distance: Lookahead distance for path following (meters)
        goal_tolerance: Distance at which the goal is considered reached (meters)
        angle_tolerance: Angle at which the goal orientation is considered reached (radians)
        robot_width: Width of the robot for visualization (meters)
        robot_length: Length of the robot for visualization (meters)
        visualization_size: Size of the visualization image in pixels
        control_frequency: Frequency at which the planner is called (Hz)
        safe_goal_distance: Distance at which to adjust the goal and ignore obstacles (meters)
        max_recovery_attempts: Maximum number of recovery attempts before failing navigation.
            If the robot gets stuck and cannot recover within this many attempts, navigation will fail.
        global_planner_plan: Optional callable to plan a global path to the goal.
            If provided, this will be used to generate a path to the goal before local planning.
