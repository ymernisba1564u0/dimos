"""Demo blueprint for ObjectSceneRegistration with hosted service.

This runs automatic object detection with optional mesh/pose enhancement.
By default, uses box-only prompting to avoid passing garbage YOLO-E labels.

Meshes are saved to `/home/dimensional/dimos/meshes` and published to RViz as
`visualization_msgs/MarkerArray` on `/object_detections/mesh_markers`.

For interactive control (list detections, trigger pipelines manually),
use demo_object_scene_registration_interactive instead.

Usage:
    # Auto mode (processes all detections with box-only prompting)
    python -m dimos.robot.cli.dimos run demo-object-scene-registration

    # Interactive mode (manual trigger, custom prompts)
    python -m dimos.perception.demo_object_scene_registration_interactive \\
        --service-url http://localhost:8080
