"""TwitchVotes: extends TwitchChat with vote tallying.

Each incoming message is passed through ``message_to_choice`` to extract a
choice string.  If the result is one of ``choices``, the vote is recorded.
At the end of each window the winning choice is published as a
:class:`TwitchChoice` on ``chat_vote_choice``.

Voting modes: plurality, majority, weighted_recent, runoff.
