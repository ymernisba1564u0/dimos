"""Pub/sub transports for streaming data between modules.

This module provides transport implementations that connect module stream
endpoints (`In[T]` and `Out[T]`). Transports handle underlying protocol
details, allowing modules to communicate without knowing whether data travels
via shared memory, LCM multicast, or other mechanisms.

Transport categories:

- **Network-capable** (LCM variants): For distributed systems where modules
  may run on different machines. Supports serialization and multicast.
- **Local-only** (SHM variants): For high-throughput communication between
  processes on the same machine. Uses shared memory for near-zero-copy transfer.

Selection guidance:

- `LCMTransport`: Default for typed messages with `lcm_encode` support
- `pLCMTransport`: Python objects without LCM encoding, network-capable
- `JpegLcmTransport`: Images over network with compression
- `pSHMTransport`: High-throughput local data (images, point clouds)
- `SHMTransport`: Raw bytes over shared memory
- `JpegShmTransport`: Local images with reduced memory footprint

Example:
    Configure transports via `.transports()` on blueprint sets:

        from dimos.core.blueprints import autoconnect
        from dimos.core.transport import LCMTransport, pSHMTransport
        from dimos.msgs.sensor_msgs import Image

        blueprint = autoconnect(
            connection(),
            perception(),
        ).transports({
            # Key: (stream_property_name, Type)
            ("color_image", Image): LCMTransport("/robot/camera", Image),
        })

All transports lazily initialize on first `broadcast()` or `subscribe()`
call. For the abstract interface, see `Transport` in `stream.py`.
