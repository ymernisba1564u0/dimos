"""Structural protocols decoupling map producers from consumers.

Robotic applications require different map representations for different tasks:
3D geometry for manipulation, 2D occupancy for obstacle detection, and costmaps
for path planning. This module provides structural protocols that allow you to
swap mapping backends without changing downstream code.

A SLAM system, map accumulator, or simulator can satisfy these protocols by declaring
the appropriate output stream.

Choose
- `Global3DMap` for detailed 3D geometry (manipulation, dense reconstruction),
- `GlobalMap` for basic obstacle detection,
- and `GlobalCostmap` for path planning

    """Protocol for modules providing a global 3D point cloud map.

    This protocol defines the interface for modules that accumulate and publish
    a 3D point cloud representation of the environment. Unlike instantaneous
    sensor scans, the global point cloud represents accumulated spatial knowledge
    built over time (e.g., from SLAM or incremental mapping).

    The protocol enables decoupling between map producers and consumers, allowing
    different mapping backends (ROS2 SLAM, custom mappers, simulation) to be
    substituted without changing downstream code.

    Example:
        Implementing the protocol::

            class CustomMapper(Module):
                global_pointcloud: Out[PointCloud2] = None  # Satisfies Global3DMap

                def publish_map(self, points: np.ndarray):

                    self.global_pointcloud.publish(pc)

    Notes:
        - Implementations in `dimos/navigation/rosnav.py` (ROSNav module)
        - The protocol specifies the interface but not publish frequency, point
          density, or how the map is accumulated
        - Coordinate frame should be a fixed world/map frame, not a moving robot frame
