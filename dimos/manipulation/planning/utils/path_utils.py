Path Utilities

Standalone utility functions for path manipulation and post-processing.
These functions are stateless and can be used by any planner implementation.

## Functions

- interpolate_path(): Interpolate path to uniform resolution
- interpolate_segment(): Interpolate between two configurations
- simplify_path(): Remove unnecessary waypoints (requires WorldSpec)
- compute_path_length(): Compute total path length in joint space
