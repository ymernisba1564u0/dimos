"""Decorator and runtime for exposing robot capabilities as LLM tool calls.

This module provides the core abstractions for defining and executing *skills*: wrappers around
robot capabilities that allow LLMs to invoke them as tool calls.
Skills transform high-level intentions (e.g., "navigate to the kitchen") into concrete actions.

Core components
---------------
`@skill` decorator
    Transforms `Module` methods into agent-callable tools with configurable execution
    semantics (streaming, passive/active behavior, thread pooling). Auto-generates JSON
    schemas for LLM tool calling.

`SkillContainer` class
    Base infrastructure inherited by all Modules, providing skill execution, threading,
    and transport. Available automatically via `Module` inheritance.

`SkillContainerConfig` dataclass
    Configuration for skill transport layer (defaults to LCM-based communication).

Architecture
------------
Skills execute in a distributed, asynchronous environment where every `Module` inherits
from `SkillContainer`. The `@skill` decorator wraps methods with execution routing and
schema generation.

See also
--------
`dimos.core.module.Module` : Base class that inherits `SkillContainer`
`dimos.protocol.skill.coordinator.SkillCoordinator` : Manages skill execution state for agents
`dimos.protocol.skill.type` : Enums and types for skill configuration
`dimos.agents2.agent` : LLM agents that discover and invoke skills

- Wire a skill to an agent tutorial: `docs/tutorials/skill_with_agent/tutorial.md`
- Explainer on the Skill concept: `docs/concepts/skills.md`

Examples
--------
Basic skill returning a result:

>>> from dimos.core.module import Module
>>> from dimos.protocol.skill.skill import skill
>>>
>>> class RobotSkills(Module):
...     @skill()
...     def greet(self, name: str) -> str:
...         '''Greet someone by name.'''
...         return f"Hello, {name}!"

Notes
-----
**Thread pool execution:**
Skills execute in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` when called via coordinator (with `call_id`),
preventing blocking during long-running operations.

**Passive skill requirements:**
Skills with `stream=Stream.passive` never wake the agent except on errors. Their data
is only delivered when an active skill keeps the agent loop running; by design,
passive skills are for auxiliary data like telemetry during primary tasks.

#
# - reducer: defines an optional strategy for passive streams and how we collapse potential
#            multiple values into something meaningful for the agent
#
#        Reducer.none: no reduction, every emitted value is returned to the agent
#        Reducer.latest: only the latest value is returned to the agent
#        Reducer.average: assumes the skill emits a number,

    The `@skill` decorator is what allows methods on a `Module` to be invoked as tool calls by LLM agents.
    It does this by wrapping methods with execution routing, message protocol handling,
    and automatic schema generation.

    When an agent calls a skill through the SkillCoordinator, the skill executes in
    a background thread pool and publishes messages tracking its execution state
    (start → [stream]* → ret/error). This enables non-blocking execution, progress
    monitoring, and distributed deployment across machines.

        ...         '''Navigate to a named location.'''
        ...         self._set_goal(location)
        ...         return f"Navigating to {location}"

        Streaming skill with progress updates:

        >>> class MonitorSkills(Module):
        ...     @skill(stream=Stream.call_agent, ret=Return.call_agent)
        ...     def monitor_task(self, count: int):

        ...         yield "Task completed"

        Passive skill with reducer aggregation:

        >>> class RobotSkills(Module):
        ...     def _get_frames(self):

        ...         '''Navigate while camera streams.'''
        ...         return f"Arrived at {location}"

        Hidden administrative skill:

        ...         return "Calibration complete"

        See also the tutorials and other examples of skills in the library.

    Notes:

        **Key Contracts:**

        - Return strings for LLM compatibility (non-strings with `agent_encode()`
          method are auto-encoded)
        - Methods must be on subclasses of Module
        - Parameters must be JSON-serializable for schema generation

        **Passive Skill Warning:** When using `stream=Stream.passive`:

        - If only passive skills are running, the loop exits and data from passive skills is lost
        See `Stream.passive` docstring for full semantics.

        **Generator skills:** Use `yield` (not `return`) for your final message.
        Only the last `yield` becomes `MsgType.ret`.

        **Best Practices:**

        - Write clear docstrings - they become the skill descriptions LLMs see
        - Return meaningful strings that help agents understand outcomes
        - Handle errors gracefully with contextual messages for agent recovery

    SkillContainer provides the foundational protocol layer inherited by all DimOS `Module`s,
    enabling any `Module` to expose `@skill` decorated methods as LLM tool calls. This class
    handles skill discovery, threaded execution, message publishing, and transport abstraction
    for distributed skill communication.

    Key capabilities:
        - **Skill introspection**: Discovers all `@skill` decorated methods via `skills()` RPC
        - **Threaded execution**: Runs skills in background thread pool (max 50 workers)
        - **Message protocol**: Publishes lifecycle events for streaming and error handling
        - **Transport abstraction**: Configurable communication layer (default: LCM-based)
        - **Lazy initialization**: Transport and thread pool created on first use

    Users typically don't interact with SkillContainer directly—it provides infrastructure
    that makes the `@skill` decorator work seamlessly across distributed deployments.

        Introspects the container's methods to find those decorated with `@skill`, returning
        their configurations for registration with the SkillCoordinator. This method enables
        automatic skill discovery without explicit registration lists.

        Discovery algorithm:
            1. Iterate over all public attribute names via `dir(self)`
            2. Exclude: names starting with `_`, and names in exclusion list
            3. Include: attributes with a `_skill_config` attribute (set by `@skill` decorator)

        The exclusion list prevents recursion and avoids accessing problematic properties:
        `{"skills", "tf", "rpc", "skill_transport"}`.

        Examples:
            Discovering skills from a container:

            >>> from dimos.core.module import Module
            >>> from dimos.protocol.skill.skill import skill

            ...         return f"Navigating to {location}"

            ...         '''Cancel current navigation.'''

        Notes:
            This method is marked `@rpc` for remote queryability by SkillCoordinator during
            skill registration. When `dynamic_skills()` returns True, this method is called
            on each coordinator query to refresh the skill set.
