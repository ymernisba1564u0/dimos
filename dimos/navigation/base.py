"""State-machine-based navigation interface for autonomous mobile robots.

This module defines the contract that all navigation backends must implement. The
interface centers on three design principles:

1. **State machine control**: Navigation has explicit states (IDLE, FOLLOWING_PATH,
   RECOVERY) that callers poll to determine progress.

2. **Non-blocking goal submission**: `set_goal()` returns immediately after accepting
   the goal, allowing agent skills to interleave navigation with perception or
   communication during long traversals.

3. **Success indicator**: When returning to IDLE, `is_goal_reached()` reports whether
   the goal was actually reached (vs. cancelled/failed), so you can check the outcome
   without polling state during the transition or maintaining external tracking.

Typical usage pattern:

```python
nav.set_goal(target_pose)
while nav.get_state() == NavigationState.FOLLOWING_PATH:
    # Optionally: check sensors, update beliefs, handle interruptions
    time.sleep(0.25)
return nav.is_goal_reached()  # True = success, False = cancelled/failed
```

            a new goal via `set_goal()`.
        FOLLOWING_PATH: Actively navigating toward a goal. Path planning
            and motion control are engaged.
