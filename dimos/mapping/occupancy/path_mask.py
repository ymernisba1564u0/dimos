    Creates a boolean mask where True indicates cells that the robot will
    occupy while following the path, accounting for the robot's width.

    Args:
        occupancy_grid: The occupancy grid providing dimensions and resolution.
        path: The path containing poses the robot will follow.
        robot_width: The width of the robot in meters.
        pose_index: The index in path.poses to start drawing from. Defaults to 0.
        max_length: Maximum cumulative length to draw. Defaults to infinity.

    Returns:
