    Unlike the regular gradient which can result in suboptimal paths in narrow
    corridors (where the center still has high cost), this method creates a cost
    map based on the Voronoi diagram of obstacles. Cells on Voronoi edges
    (equidistant from multiple obstacles) have minimum cost, encouraging paths
    that stay maximally far from all obstacles.

    For a corridor of width 10 cells:
    - Regular gradient: center cells might be 95 (still high cost)
    - Voronoi gradient: center cells are 0 (optimal path)

    The cost is interpolated based on relative position between the nearest
    obstacle and the nearest Voronoi edge:
    - At obstacle: cost = 100
    - At Voronoi edge: cost = 0
    - In between: cost = 99 * d_voronoi / (d_obstacle + d_voronoi)
